"strings.py - Multi-language support for Pyro."

# THIS GAME IS STILL IN ALPHA!  It's probably way too soon to start working on
# a translation, since lots of these messages are going to change, and lots more
# are going to be added, in the near future.

# NOTES FOR TRANSLATION:

#  When '%s' appears in a string, the game will substitute a value at that position.
#  For instance, "You equip %s." could become "You equip the sword.",
#  or "You equip Obliteron, Almighty Greathammer of the Seventeen Hells."
#   - Examples of fill-in values are given in comments at the end of such lines.

# - Sequences like ^G^ and ^r^ are color codes.  The codes are:
#   - k:black  b:blue  g:green  c:cyan  r:red  m:magenta  y:yellow  w:white
#   - Capital letters result in bright versions of the same color.
#   - The sequence ^0^ (zero, not the letter O) is used to restore the default color.

# HOW TO ADD SUPPORT FOR ANOTHER LANGUAGE:
# Subclass the English class, and begin overriding properties.  Subclassing rather
# than creating a sibling class will ensure that any missing messages will
# appear in English, instead of crashing the game.  Then, at the bottom of this
# file, change the line that reads "lang = English()" to reference your new
# language instead.  (This will probably be moved to an in-game menu eventually.)

His skills are focused on observation and survival."
